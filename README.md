# Bistable Precision Dynamics and Informational Reversal
## A Computational Mechanism of Defensive Functional Decoupling

**Official Simulation Code Repository** **Manuscript Status:** Under Review at *PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences)*

This repository contains the source code used to generate the computational results and figures presented in the manuscript: *"Bistable Precision Dynamics and Informational Reversal: A Computational Mechanism of Defensive Functional Decoupling"*.

The code implements the **Gradient-based Coupled Active Inference (G-CAI) Kuramoto model**, simulating how chronic functional disorders emerge as metastable attractors driven by defensive precision collapse and hysteresis.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* **`core_simulation.py`** The core physics engine. It simulates the time-series evolution of the system, precision dynamics, and the hysteresis loop.
   * **Generates Figure 1:** Phase dynamics, precision collapse, and recovery via Specific Informational Perturbation (SIP).
   * **Generates Figure 2:** The hysteresis loop showing the bistable region (Defensive vs. Healthy wells).

* **`sensitivity_analysis.py`** Performs a comprehensive parameter sweep to validate the topological robustness of the model.
   * **Generates Figure 3:** Phase diagram (heatmap) of steady-state precision against Error Sensitivity ($\alpha$) and Environmental Uncertainty ($\sigma$).

* **`requirements.txt`** List of Python dependencies required to run the simulations.
